Astrophysicist studying the galactic ecosystem, the physics of the interstellar medium and star formation, and the effects of feedback processes from small to large scales. Ph.D. from Seoul National University, Korea in 2011.

Everyday tasks: coding in python, C, C++; writing/solving/deriving equations with pen and papers (on iPad these days); discussing with colleagues and students; playing with Jeanne.

Love to stare at and take pictures of night skies. Love to play sports using balls and something (bats, raquets, cues, etc). Try to love biking and running (not quite).
